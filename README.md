# TelegramAPI
A simple library for interact with the Telegram's API.

## Usage
Use this library is pretty straightfoward. First you have to create a new instance of TelegramAPI passing the token generated by Telegram:
```python
from telegramapi.telegram.api import TelegramAPI

token = "TokenGeneratedByTelegram"
api = TelegramAPI(token)
```

Now that you have created the instace, you can call all the methods defined in the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) page.

This library is updated with the changes of November, 2015.
